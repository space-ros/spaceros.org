Tools and processes for improving the certifiability of ROS 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

High-integrity applications of robotics, such as aerospace and medical devices, require verification and validation of the correct behaviour of ROS 2.
This talk showcases tools and processes being used as part of the Space ROS project to improve the applicability of ROS 2 to such domains.
Our tools for managing open-source requirements and static analysis results, such as from IKOS and Cobra, can be used as input to a validation or certification process.
The talk describes their usage in improving the quality of ROS 2.
