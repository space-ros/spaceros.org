This is the presentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using ROS in space systems has unique challenges including radiation, communication, and safety. 
Space systems must be somewhat error tolerant to radiation bit flips, must communicate over significant lag, restricted bandwidth and dropouts, and must operate in a known safe manner. 
This talk provides an overview of Robonaut 2â€™s mobility upgrade. 
It also includes an overview of the safety and communication systems and discusses the challenges faced and how ROS and OROCOS were used to solve them.
